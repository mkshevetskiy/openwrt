Subject: [PATCH 26/27] dt-bindings: clock: airoha: Document support for AN7583
 clock

Document support for Airoha AN7583 clock. This is based on the EN7523
clock schema with the new requirement of the "airoha,chip-scu"
(previously optional for EN7581).

Add additional binding for additional clock and reset lines.
